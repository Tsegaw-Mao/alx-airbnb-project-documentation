# Airbnb Clone – User Stories

This document outlines user stories that represent the core functionalities from the backend use case diagram. Each story is written from the perspective of a primary actor: Guest, Host, or Admin.

#### **User Stories**: Create user stories to describe how different types of users will interact with the system. This helps in identifying the backend functionalities required to support these interactions.

#### Example: 
- “As a `user`, I want to be able to `register` an account so that I can `log in` and access personalized features.”
- “As a `guest`, I want to `view detailed property` information so that I can make an informed booking decision.”
