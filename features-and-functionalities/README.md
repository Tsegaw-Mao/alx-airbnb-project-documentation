# üè° Airbnb Clone Backend ‚Äì Project Requirements

## Objective
To design and implement a scalable, secure, and robust backend system for an Airbnb-like rental marketplace platform.

This document outlines the **core**, **technical**, and **non-functional** requirements for building the backend.

---

## Introduction

Backend development is responsible for the server-side logic, database interactions, API endpoints, and integrations. The Airbnb Clone backend must power all user and property-related features while maintaining performance, security, and scalability.

---

## Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management

- **User Registration**
  - Guests and hosts can sign up.
  - Secure signup using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.

- **Login and Authentication**
  - Login using email and password.
  - Support **OAuth** providers (Google, Facebook).

- **Profile Management**
  - Update personal information, profile photos, contact info, and preferences.

---

### 2. Property Listings Management

- **Add Listings**
  - Hosts can create listings with:
    - Title, description, location, price, amenities, availability.

- **Edit/Delete Listings**
  - Hosts can update or remove their listings.

---

### 3. Search and Filtering

- Enable property search by:
  - Location
  - Price range
  - Number of guests
  - Amenities (Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)

- Include **pagination** for large datasets.

---

### 4. Booking Management

- **Booking Creation**
  - Guests can book properties for specific dates.
  - Prevent double bookings via date validation.

- **Booking Cancellation**
  - Hosts and guests can cancel bookings.
  - Respect cancellation policies.

- **Booking Status**
  - Track statuses: `pending`, `confirmed`, `canceled`, `completed`.

---

### 5. Payment Integration

- Use payment gateways like **Stripe** or **PayPal**.
- Features:
  - Guest payments during booking.
  - Host payouts after booking completion.
  - Multi-currency support.

---

### 6. Reviews and Ratings

- **Guests** can leave reviews and ratings.
- **Hosts** can respond to reviews.
- Reviews must be linked to actual bookings.

---

### 7. Notification System

- Send notifications via:
  - Email (SendGrid, Mailgun)
  - In-app alerts

- Triggered on:
  - Booking confirmations/cancellations
  - Payment updates

---

### 8. Admin Dashboard

Admins can manage:
- Users
- Listings
- Bookings
- Payments

---

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management

- Use **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**
- Required tables:
  - `users`
  - `properties`
  - `bookings`
  - `reviews`
  - `payments`

---

### 2. API Development

- Use **RESTful APIs**
  - Use appropriate HTTP methods:
    - `GET`, `POST`, `PUT/PATCH`, `DELETE`
  - Use correct HTTP status codes

- Optional: **GraphQL** for advanced querying

---

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

- Use **JWT** for authentication.
- Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for:
  - Guests
  - Hosts
  - Admins

---

### 4. File Storage

- Use cloud storage (e.g., **AWS S3**, **Cloudinary**) for:
  - Property images
  - User profile photos
- Implementation will use **local file storage** for this version.

---

### 5. Third-Party Services

- Email: **SendGrid** or **Mailgun**
- OAuth: Google, Facebook

---

### 6. Error Handling and Logging

- Implement **global API error handling**
- Log key events and errors

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability

- Use **modular architecture**
- Enable **horizontal scaling** with load balancers

---

### 2. Security

- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment info)
- Implement:
  - **Rate limiting**
  - **Firewalls**
  - **Validation/sanitization**

---

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Use **Redis** for caching (e.g., search results)
- Optimize database queries

---

### 4. Testing

- Use frameworks like **pytest** for:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
- Automated API tests to validate endpoints
